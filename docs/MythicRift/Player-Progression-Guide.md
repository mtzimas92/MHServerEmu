# Cosmic Rift Player Progression Guide

Use this as the short playtest instruction sheet when Test Center starts from a fresh database.

## Quick Summary

- Every player starts with Cosmic Rift level `1` unlocked and Endless Rift level `1` unlocked.
- Cosmic Rift and Endless Rift now have separate progression and separate scaling.
- Using a Rift launcher item starts that mode's highest unlocked Rift level by default.
- Completing Rift level `N` unlocks Rift level `N+1`.
- Failing, abandoning, leaving early, or timing out does not unlock the next level.
- One launcher item is consumed per Rift attempt.
- Players can launch from the Danger Room hub, or from inside a Cosmic Rift that has already been successfully cleared.

## Normal Player Flow

1. Go to the Danger Room hub.
2. Buy the Rift launcher item from the Danger Room vendor.
3. Optional: type `rift status` to see your highest unlocked level and next launch level.
4. Use the launcher item from the Danger Room hub.
5. Clear the Rift objective before the timer expires.
6. Kill the Rift boss when it appears.
7. After completion, either use the exit portal to return to the Danger Room hub, or use another launcher item from the cleared Rift to chain directly into the next run.
8. Buy/use another launcher item to continue to the next Rift level.

## Classic Rift Levels

Most Rift levels use the classic flow:

1. Enter a random Rift map.
2. Kill enemies until the progress bar / kill quota is complete.
3. The final boss spawns only after the kill quota is complete.
4. Kill the boss before the timer expires.
5. Eligible players unlock the next Rift level.

## Checkpoint Rift Levels

Every 5th level is a boss-only checkpoint:

- Rift levels `5`, `10`, `15`, etc. are mandatory checkpoint levels.
- These use smaller rooms instead of normal terminal maps.
- There is no kill quota phase.
- The boss spawns immediately and is tuned to be harder.
- Clearing level `5` unlocks level `6`, clearing level `10` unlocks level `11`, and so on.

## Group Progression Rules

Cosmic Rift progression is competitive but group-friendly:

- The run is valid for the group if the Rift objectives are completed before the timer expires.
- The party leader does not own the run after launch; if the leader disconnects or leaves, remaining players can still finish if they stay inside.
- Players do not need to be alive at the end, but they must still be present inside the Rift when the boss dies.
- In classic Rift levels, players should be inside the Rift when the kill quota unlocks the boss and still inside when the boss dies.
- In checkpoint Rift levels, players should be inside the Rift when the checkpoint boss dies.
- A player who leaves the Rift early becomes ineligible for rewards and next-level unlocks for that run.
- Completing a Rift above your personal maximum advances your personal maximum by one level only; it no longer jumps directly to the host's completed tier.
- If everyone leaves, the Rift is cleaned up and a new launcher item is required.

All intended party members must be online and standing in the leader's current region when the launcher item is used. Only members whose Rift teleport succeeds are admitted, counted for scaling, and eligible for rewards.

## Player Commands

```text
rift status
```

Shows whether you have an active Rift, your highest unlocked Rift level, and the level your next launcher item will open.
When no run is active, this reports both Cosmic and Endless progression.

```text
rift level
```

Shows your next Cosmic Rift launch level and highest unlocked Cosmic level.

```text
rift level endless
```

Shows your next Endless Rift launch level and highest unlocked Endless level.

```text
rift level X
```

Arms one lower-level Cosmic farming run, if level `X` is already unlocked. This does not lower your progression and is consumed after the next successful Cosmic launcher use.

Example: if your highest unlocked level is `50`, `rift level 25` makes only the next launcher open level `25`. After that launch, future launchers go back to level `50` by default.

```text
rift level endless X
rift level X endless
```

Arms one lower-level Endless farming run. Cosmic and Endless selections are separate.

```text
rift level max
```

Clears the Cosmic one-shot lower-level selection and makes the next Cosmic launcher use your highest unlocked Cosmic level.

```text
rift level endless max
```

Clears the Endless one-shot lower-level selection.

```text
rift abandon
```

Cancels your active Rift attempt, returns online participants to the Danger Room hub, and allows a fresh attempt. This costs the current Rift attempt.

```text
rift recover
```

Emergency test command. Clears temporary Cosmic and Endless launcher state and safely abandons/removes your active Rift if your session gets stuck.

## What Players Should Avoid During Playtests

- Do not use Rift launcher items in Story Mode or uncleared maps.
- Using another launcher from a successfully cleared Cosmic Rift is allowed for chaining.
- Do not relog as the first solution if a Rift is stuck; try `rift recover` first.
- Do not use admin-only commands such as `rift armbeaconfixed`, `rift setaccess`, or `rift resetprogress` during normal player-flow testing unless MonEll specifically asks for it.
- Do not expect `rift level X` to permanently set your farm level. It is intentionally one-shot.

## Admin Reset For Fresh Tests

Admins can reset a tester back to Rift level `1` with:

```text
rift resetprogress
```

This resets Cosmic progression. Use `rift resetprogress endless` to reset Endless progression. Each reset also clears that mode's one-shot launch level selection.

## Individual Area Test Commands

Use these admin commands when MonEll wants testers to validate one specific map instead of the normal random pool.

The final number is the Rift level. In these examples it is `10`, but it can be changed to a higher or lower number for focused scaling tests.

```text
!rift armbeaconfixed sabretooth-showdown 10
!rift armbeaconfixed supervillain-rec-center 10
!rift armbeaconfixed sc-kill-house 10
!rift armbeaconfixed sc-missile-silo 10
!rift armbeaconfixed sc-mineshaft 10
!rift armbeaconfixed sc-dino-graveyard 10
!rift armbeaconfixed sc-fire-swamp 10
!rift armbeaconfixed tr-asgard-estate 10
!rift armbeaconfixed tr-norway-tomb 10

!rift armbeaconfixed magneto 10
!rift armbeaconfixed sinister 10
!rift armbeaconfixed modok 10
!rift armbeaconfixed mandarin 10
!rift armbeaconfixed kingpin 10
!rift armbeaconfixed ultron 10
!rift armbeaconfixed bronx-zoo 10
!rift armbeaconfixed wakanda-jungle 10
!rift armbeaconfixed daily-bugle 10

!rift armbeaconfixed cosmic-doop-sector 10
```

## Suggested Fresh-Database Playtest Script

1. Confirm every tester starts with `rift status`.
2. Everyone should see highest unlocked Rift level `1`.
3. Solo player launches and clears level `1`.
4. Confirm `rift status` now shows highest unlocked level `2`.
5. Repeat until level `3` or `4` to confirm normal chaining.
6. Test `rift level 1` after unlocking higher levels, then launch once.
7. Confirm the following launch returns to the highest unlocked level by default.
8. Test a party run with all players standing in the Danger Room hub before launch.
9. Confirm all players who stay inside until boss death unlock the next level.
10. If a session gets stuck, use `rift recover` and report the map, boss, current `rift status`, and any server log around the issue.
