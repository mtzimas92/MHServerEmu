# Mythic Rift V1 Spec

## Document Goal

- Define a first playable, simple, and integrable version of Mythic Rift.
- Serve as the basis for local implementation and then a patch proposal for TAHITI.

## V1 Scope

- Instanced mode for 1 to 5 players.
- An interaction launches the content.
- The exact entry point will be defined later.
- A map is randomly selected from an approved pool.
- A final boss is randomly selected from an approved pool.
- The run is limited by a timer.
- Level progression is supported.
- Every 5th level is a boss-only checkpoint room instead of a classic quota map.
- End rewards reuse existing systems as much as possible.
- V1 must not depend on a manually distributed client patch.

## V1 Objective

- Deliver a first mode that is fun, replayable, and stable.
- Minimize technical debt.
- Avoid systems that are too ambitious for the first iteration.

## V1 Gameplay Loop

1. The player or group interacts with the Rift entry point.
2. The system determines the requested Rift level.
3. The server verifies that the level is unlocked for the player or leader.
4. The server creates a Rift instance.
5. The server selects a random map from the V1 pool, or a checkpoint boss room on levels 5/10/15/etc.
6. The server selects a random boss from the V1 pool.
7. Players enter the instance.
8. The timer starts.
9. In classic Rift levels, players kill the required enemy quota.
10. In classic Rift levels, the server spawns the randomized Rift boss only after the quota is completed.
11. In checkpoint Rift levels, the server spawns the empowered randomized boss immediately.
12. If the final boss dies before the timer ends, the run succeeds.
13. If the timer expires first, the run fails.
14. On success, players receive end-of-run loot.
15. On success, the next level is unlocked.

## V1 Group Rules

- Allowed group size: 1 to 5 players.
- The mode must work in solo without group prerequisites.
- In a group, V1 should ideally use the level selected by the leader.
- All players present in the instance at the start participate in the run.

## Victory Condition

- The run is won when the Rift final boss dies before the timer expires.

## Failure Condition

- The run is lost when the timer expires before the final boss dies.
- When the timer expires, online players still inside the Rift should be returned to the Danger Room hub automatically.

## Timer

- Exact timer values will be defined later.
- V1 should support a visible timer through existing mission systems if possible.
- If the existing client widgets do not render a safe timer, chat warnings are the guaranteed fallback.
- The timer should ideally start when the run becomes active.

## Level Progression

- Levels start at 1.
- Progression is potentially open-ended.
- Success at level N unlocks N+1.
- Beacon launches default to the player's highest unlocked level.
- Players may choose a lower unlocked launch level for farming through a server-side command until a cleaner no-client-patch UI is available.
- Levels divisible by 5 are mandatory checkpoint levels: clearing level 4 unlocks level 5, but clearing the level 5 boss-only checkpoint is required to unlock level 6.

## Loot and Rewards

- On timed success, the run grants an end reward.
- That reward should primarily reuse:
  - existing random world drops
  - the selected final boss's normal drops
- In addition, V1 applies a significant SIF / RIF bonus.
- Boss-only checkpoint levels can apply a small extra timed-success bonus to make the mandatory tier gate feel more rewarding than a normal level.
- The bonus, primary loot table, extra loot tables, level ranges, and inventory-vs-ground delivery should be configurable and easy for TAHITI to tune through a server JSON file.

## V1 UI / UX

- Reuse existing mission / metagame widgets if possible.
- Avoid heavy custom UI in V1.
- Suppress misleading native terminal objective text during active Rift runs, because the Rift boss can differ from the terminal's normal boss; current implementation may temporarily suspend the native terminal mission inside the Rift instance to achieve this without a client patch.
- Suppress native `Region Events` objective tracker entries during active Rift runs; the current approach temporarily suspends those region-event missions only inside the active Rift instance and restores them when the run is cleaned up.
- Prefer a simple kill-count objective first, then reveal the boss name only when the quota is complete.
- In boss-only checkpoint rooms, hide the kill-count widget and show only the Rift level, timer, boss spawn message, and completion/failure feedback.
- Intercept native mission/objective updates for controlled terminal objectives while a Rift is active, otherwise the client may rebuild terminal bounty counters after server-side widget suppression.
- If the client keeps a native generic fraction tracker visible, the server may reuse it as a best-effort Rift kill quota counter.
- If native terminal objective tracker text cannot be safely replaced without a client patch, hide it during the Rift instead and rely on chat feedback plus `rift status`.
- Dynamic per-player item tooltip text for highest/selected Rift level is not expected to be practical without a client patch; use chat/server commands or a future server-driven interaction flow instead.
- If game file changes are required for entry-point presentation, they should ideally be deployable through the Patcher.

## TAHITI Compatibility

- The patch must be readable and clean.
- Core logic should stay server-side as much as possible.
- Any dependency on game files should remain minimal and Patcher-compatible.
